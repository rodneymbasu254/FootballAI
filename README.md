 A football  AI model
 
## How the model works
 I am fascinated by how EAs FC franchise rates soccer players. So i wanted to understand, what feature contributes more to overall rating, in my case REACTIONS.
 In this model i used sample dummy values to determine an overall rating(The values used were close to Messi's values) and turns out that the model was 90+ percent accurate. Still want to add more features including UI(Gradio for now). So the core function is to try and estimate the overall rating, for example imagine you as a player and try to estimate your overall rating, funny, right?
 
 ## What was used
 I implemented both machine learning and deep learning to try and find the best accurate model.
 It turns out that deep learning wqas the best, tested with 100 epochs

 ## What it means for me
 It has been a good way for me to learn more on deep learning and ml, this was a sample project. I still want to add more ideas to it and i am really excited about it.
